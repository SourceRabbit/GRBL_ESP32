Grbl is a no-compromise, high performance, motion control for CNC milling. This version of Grbl is a fork of the [Grbl_Esp32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32) project, runs on ESP32 processors and it is designed to work properly with  SourceRabbit products like the [4-axis CNC motherboard](https://www.sourcerabbit.com/Shop/pr-i-86-t-4-axis-cnc-motherboard.htm).

The controller is written in highly optimized C utilizing every clever feature of the ESP32-chips to achieve precise timing and asynchronous operation. It is able to maintain up to 120khZ of stable, jitter free control pulses.

We keep this fork updated in order to be fully compatible with our products.
