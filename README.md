### Introduction 
Grbl is a no-compromise, high performance, motion control for CNC milling. This version of Grbl is a fork of the [Grbl_Esp32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32) project, runs on ESP32 processors and it is designed to work properly with  SourceRabbit products like the [4-axis CNC motherboard](https://www.sourcerabbit.com/Shop/pr-i-86-t-4-axis-cnc-motherboard.htm) and [Focus- CNC Control System](https://www.sourcerabbit.com/Shop/pr-i-91-t-focus-cnc-control-software.htm).

The controller is highly optimized to achieve precise timing and asynchronous operation. It is able to maintain up to <b>120khZ of stable, jitter free control pulses</b>.
